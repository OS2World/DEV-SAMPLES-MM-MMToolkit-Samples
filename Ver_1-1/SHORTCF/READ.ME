        The CONTROL.SCR might be thought of like a config.sys.
It tells the package name, the codepage, where the filelist is that
will be used, how many groups there are, how many diskettes there
are, and the media names to be used on the diskettes.  It sets
the environment for where the files are coming from and where they
are going.  It also defines the groups that will be involved by defining
their group number, size, name, version and where the file is that
will be used to change the ini file.

        The FILELIST file contains the number of files that are used, then
defines what disk they are on, what group they are in, what the
destination directory will be, what source directory to use and the
file name.

        The other .SCR files define whether this is a program or a folder and
then where to locate the associated icons.

        The .CH files make the necessary changes to the config.sys in the path
and set statements.

        All of these files are interrelated in the sense that the install
needs to know all the information above to successfully install the component.
In other words the install program reads the CONTROL.SCR for the
environment and paths, then goes to the filelist and puts the files where
they belong, then goes to the .SCR files and puts the folders or programs
in there respective areas and finally changes the config.sys to be able to
find all the various files.  There are many other functions necessary for a
more complicated install process so please refer to chapter 6 in the
programers guide for more documentation.
